#  Title 

## Abstract

Short description of your project. Max 10 sentences. This **SHOULD NOT** be a
copy of the project idea text.

## Technical Details

Long description of the project. **Must** include all technical details of the
project, like libraries involved.

Here it is also important to document previous conversations with your prospective mentors. You can show relevant pieces of code that you want to change. You can link to literature you used during the research.

### Contributions So Far
Write a subsection which lists your contributions so far to Orcasound or the project. This may include:

* Issues, PRs
* Resources Review
* Preliminary Attempts

Provide links whenever possible.

## Schedule of Deliverables

Here should provide a list of your milestones. Below are a series of suggested sub-sections based on the
different phases of GSoC. You can use it as a template, but you can/should add more details
for each phase, e.g. by breaking it down into weeks or setting specific targets for each
phase. Each target should be split into sub-tasks with time estimates. [Work
breakdown structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) may be helpful here.

### **Community Bonding Period**

This phase is to get to know the community better. Check that your build environment is setup. This time should also be used to discuss your project in more detail with the community, including introducing yourself and beginning to vet your ideas. 

*Note:* We require you to write regular blog posts. Now is a good time to become familiar with blogging in Wordpress, or let us know you already know how to use it. If you are accepted, we will provide you with an account on the Orcasound blog.
